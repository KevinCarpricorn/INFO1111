## </font><font size=3>Introduction</font>

</font><font size=1.5>One of the most important skills any computing graduate needs to develop is the ability to learn things independently. Because our field changes so rapidly, much of what you will need or want to work with in the future doesn't exist yet, and so you can't learn it while you are at university. </font>

</font><font size=1.5>The skills required to learn something on your own though change much more slowly. Some of them have been the same for hundreds of years - some of them are internet skills and are more recent. You will be introduced to some of these skills and be asked to apply them to learn things on your own in INFO1111.</font>

</font><font size=1.5>This recognition of the need to `learn to learn` has been around for a while now:</font>

</font><font size=1.5>\- Alvin Toffler </font>

</font><font size=1.5>(this quote may explain some of those advertisements the university is so fond of putting up around campus and its website ðŸ˜„)</font>

*****

</font><font size=1.5>Your first task is to reproduce this document using a specific technology - **Markdown**. Markdown is what I have used to create this document myself, and so you should be able to create a perfect copy of it.</font>

## </font><font size=3>Suggested Approach</font>

</font><font size=1.5>Here is a basic suggested path for you to take (this same initial process applies to pretty much everything you might want to self-learn):</font>

- [x] </font><font size=1.5>First, find out what Markdown is</font>
- [ ] </font><font size=1.5>Find some resources that explain how to use Markdown</font>

- [ ] </font><font size=1.5>Experiment with and explore Markdown on your own</font>
- [ ] </font><font size=1.5>Try and recreate this document as precisely as you can</font>

</font><font size=1.5>This task is a 'trial run' before you get ~~thrown into the deep end~~ asked to learn something on your own without much support from teaching staff. To be clear - you will get as much support as we can possibly offer to do with how to learn - but you will be almost entirely on your own in terms of the thing you are learning. While this Markdown task is not assessed, and could be completed in a couple of hours, you will soon be asked to develop a plan for learning something more substantial. Use this task to practice finding and studying resources on your own before the real thing!</font>

</font><font size=1.5>As a suggestion, create a resource list. This list will help you in a few ways:  </font>

+ </font><font size=1.5>Keeping track of resources you have found so you don't lose track of them while you search for other resources.</font>

* </font><font size=1.5>Helping you to create a bibliography and reference list when you write up your work (you don't need to do this for this markdown task, but you do for your main self-learning report).</font>
* </font><font size=1.5>When someone asks you in a few months or years how to do something you have learned, you have resources to direct them to.</font>

</font><font size=1.5>You can store this in a few ways - from something as informal as a folder of bookmarks in your browser, to a list you save in Dropbox/Onedrive/</font>

</font><font size=1.5> 1. First resource</font>

</font> <font size=1.5>2. Second resource</font>

â€¦

</font><font size=1.5>10. Tenth resource and so on</font>

</font><font size=1.5>or you could use a table in Excel or similar:  </font>

| <center>Resource</center>                                    | <center>Notes</center>                                       |

| </font><font size=1.5><www.okwebsite.com/info.html></font>   | </font><font size=1.5>Has some basic information on what to use X for but not a lot of detail about how to use it</font> |
| </font><font size=1.5><www.betterwebsite.com/tutorial.asp></font> | </font><font size=1.5>Has an in-depth tutorial on using X</font> |
| </font><font size=1.5><www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ></font> | </font><font size=1.5>Has a worked solution on video</font>  |

## </font><font size=3>Submission</font>

</font><font size=1.5>Once you are ready, upload your document **as a pdf** to the [submission link on Canvas](https://canvas.sydney.edu.au/courses/30098/assignments/283513). Remember that this is not assessed - this is just so your tutor can see where you are up to if you have any questions (remember they won't tell you anything at all about Markdown itself - just how to find out about it on your own).</font>

</font><font size=1.5>Make sure you try this on your own! Having a friend teach you what they have learned isn't going to help you with the skills we are actually assessing you on.</font>
